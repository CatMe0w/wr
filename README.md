## Introduction

`wr` is a WebAssembly runtime written in Haskell. This project is primarily focused on learning, research, and exploration of WebAssembly internals and Haskell.

The project is not intended to be used in production.

### Motivation

- Understanding WebAssembly specification through implementation
- Exploring Haskell's capabilities in system programming
- Creating a fun and educational playground for WebAssembly experiments

```
Lost all my precious
Rage ate me up
Endless forlornness has made me numb
I'd rather rise from here
Or should I hold on to my past?

Theyâ€™ve burnt to ashes
Faded to grey
Returned to the earth
Yes it's meant to be
Uncertain flame of hope I found
Will you lead me back on the right track?
```
